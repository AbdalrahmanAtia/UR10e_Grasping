ros2 launch robotiq_description robotiq_control.launch.py
  ```

##### Gripper limits: 0 or 0.1 (fully open) - 0.8 (fully closed)

```bash
# Closing the gripper
ros2 action send_goal /robotiq_gripper_controller/gripper_cmd control_msgs/action/GripperCommand "{command: {position: 0.8, max_effort: 50.0}}"
  ```

```bash
# Opening the gripper
ros2 action send_goal /robotiq_gripper_controller/gripper_cmd control_msgs/action/GripperCommand "{command: {position: 0.1, max_effort: 50.0}}"
  ```



### Running Python Files

```bash
# Run Python files directly
/usr/bin/python3.10 calibration.py
  ```

```bash
# Or using ROS2
ros2 run my_pkg sub_realsense.py
  ```

### Network Connection Issue Solution

To make sure the robot is connected to the PC:
```bash
ping 192.168.56.101   # adjust the IP based on your robot's IP.
  ```
if it pings and you can see information are continuously recieved, the PC is connected to the robot.

```bash
# Adjust the connection name and robot IP
sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 2" ipv4.addresses 192.168.56.66/24
sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 2" ipv4.method manual
sudo nmcli con up "Wired connection 2"
  ```

### Install All Required ROS Packages

```bash
# Ensure all required ROS packages are installed
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths /opt/ros/humble/share --ignore-src -r -y
  ```

## Submodules

This project uses Git submodules for external dependencies. Ensure the submodules are correctly initialized and updated as described above.

- **`abdo_ws/src/gripper`**: This submodule points to the [Robotiq gripper driver repository](https://github.com/AbdalrahmanAtia/ros2_robotiq_gripper.git).
- **`abdo_ws/src/serial`**: This submodule points to a repository containing serial communication packages or configurations necessary for the gripper driver. If you need to change or update this submodule, modify the URL in the `.gitmodules` file which now contains this repository [Serial Repository](https://github.com/AbdalrahmanAtia/serial.git).

### Updating Submodules

If there are updates in the submodules, you can pull those updates using:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

# Robot Grasp Coordinator

This project is a ROS2-based application designed to coordinate the grasping and manipulation of objects using a robotic arm. The system uses a combination of vision-based grasp detection and robot control commands to execute tasks such as detecting objects, grasping them, and performing various actions like releasing the object and returning the robot to a home position.

The `RobotGraspCoordinator` node is the central part of this application, handling all the stages of the grasping workflow, including image capture, grasp detection, pose transformation, robot movement, and gripper control. The system also includes key functionalities like visualizing grasps and gracefully shutting down the program using a keyboard press.

## ------ For more details, please check the README file in abdo_ws/src/app. -------

## **Features**

- **Robot Control**: Integrates with a robotic arm using the RTDE (Real-Time Data Exchange) interface to move the robot, execute grasp poses, and control the gripper.
- **Grasp Detection**: Uses computer vision (via OpenCV) to detect potential grasps from RGB-D camera images.
- **Grasp Execution**: Allows execution of grasp actions on detected objects.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the detected grasps in real-time using Open3D.
- **Key-Based Control**: Includes keyboard inputs (`'e'`, `'v'`, `'q'`) for controlling the system and shutting it down.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Listens for a `'q'` key press to safely shut down the program.

## Dependencies

This application requires the following dependencies to function correctly:

- ROS 2 (Humble or later)
- `rtde_receive`, `rtde_control` for robot communication
- `open3d` for 3D visualization
- `opencv-python` for image processing
- `cv_bridge` for converting ROS images to OpenCV format
- `keyboard` for listening to keyboard events
- `numpy` and other utility libraries for calculations and transformations

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install open3d opencv-python numpy keyboard
```

## ROS Dependencies

The following ROS packages are required for the proper functioning of this system:

- **rclpy**: ROS 2 Python client library, which allows the node to communicate with the ROS network.
- **geometry_msgs**: Contains message types for geometry (such as poses, transforms, etc.).
- **sensor_msgs**: Contains message types for sensor data, including images.
- **message_filters**: Helps synchronize messages (such as color and depth images) for processing.
- **tf2_ros**: A package for managing coordinate frame transformations in ROS.
- **cv_bridge**: A ROS package to convert images between ROS image messages and OpenCV image format.

These dependencies can be installed as part of the ROS 2 package setup. Ensure that you have ROS 2 installed and set up the appropriate workspace.


## Setup and Usage

**Run the Robot Grasp Coordinator Node**

You can run the node using this command:

```bash
cd src/app/app
```

```bash
sh app.sh
```

This will initialize the RobotGraspCoordinator node, which will start the iterative grasping process.


**Interact with the System**

- Press 'e' to execute the grasp action (if a valid grasp is detected).
- Press 'v' to visualize the detected grasps.
- Press 'q' to gracefully shut down the system.
